# Host Screen Swiping Feature Documentation

## Overview
The host swiping feature is implemented in the Social tab's Host section, allowing dinner party hosts to review and manage group requests through an interactive card-based interface.

## Component Structure

### Main Components
1. `HostScreen` (Main Container)
   - Manages the overall state and logic
   - Handles card transitions and swipe actions
   - Contains mock data for simulation

2. `GroupCard` (Card Component)
   - Displays individual group profiles
   - Handles swipe gestures and animations
   - Contains scrollable content with videos and member profiles

### State Management
1. Screen-level State:
   - `currentIndex`: Tracks current card position
   - `isFinished`: Indicates when all cards are reviewed
   - `isAccepted`: Indicates when a group is accepted
   - `brightness`: Manages video brightness based on device theme
   - `translateX`: Shared value for horizontal swipe animation
   - `glowOpacity`: Shared value for swipe effect intensity

2. Card-level State:
   - `isScrolling`: Prevents swipe during content scroll
   - `translateY`: Vertical position animation
   - `scale`: Card scale animation
   - `opacity`: Card opacity animation

## Features

### Card Display
- Full-screen card layout with white background
- Drop shadow for depth
- Rounded corners (20pt radius)
- Header with group name
- Scrollable content area

### Content Structure
1. Videos Section
   - Three auto-playing, looping videos
   - Muted playback
   - Cover resize mode
   - Responsive height based on screen width

2. Members Section
   - Horizontal layout of member profiles
   - Circular profile pictures (100x100)
   - Member names below pictures
   - SDSU purple (#4B2E83) for text

### Swipe Interactions
1. Left Swipe (Reject):
   - Card rotates counterclockwise
   - Slides off screen to the left
   - Shows next card in stack
   - "No more groups to see" when finished

2. Right Swipe (Accept):
   - Card rotates clockwise
   - Confirmation alert appears
   - If confirmed, shows acceptance screen
   - If cancelled, card returns to center

### Animation Details
- Spring animations for natural movement
- Rotation interpolation (-30° to 30°)
- Scale animation for inactive cards (0.9)
- Fade transitions for card changes
- Velocity-based swipe detection

## Technical Implementation

### Constants
- `CARD_WIDTH`: Screen width - 40px
- `VIDEO_HEIGHT`: Equal to screen width
- `SWIPE_THRESHOLD`: 120 (velocity threshold)
- `SWIPE_DURATION`: 400ms
- `FADE_DURATION`: 300ms

### Animation Configuration
```typescript
SPRING_CONFIG = {
  stiffness: 100,
  damping: 20
}
```

### Mock Data Structure
```typescript
interface GroupMember {
  name: string;
  profilePic: 'ian' | 'eli' | 'adam';
}

interface Group {
  id: string;
  members: GroupMember[];
}
```

### Key Animations
1. Card Transform:
   ```typescript
   transform: [
     { translateX: translateX.value },
     { translateY: translateY.value },
     { rotate: `${rotate}deg` },
     { scale: scale.value }
   ]
   ```

2. Card Styling:
   ```typescript
   card: {
     width: CARD_WIDTH,
     height: '100%',
     borderRadius: 20,
     backgroundColor: '#fff',
     shadowColor: '#000',
     shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 12 },
     shadowOpacity: 0.6,
     shadowRadius: 24,
     elevation: 24
   }
   ```

## States and Transitions

### Initial State
- Shows first card at full scale
- Next card visible behind at 0.9 scale
- White background
- Prominent shadow

### During Swipe
- Card follows finger movement
- Rotation based on swipe direction
- Shadow maintains depth effect
- Content remains scrollable

### After Swipe
1. Rejection (Left):
   - Card exits left
   - Next card animates to full scale
   - Counter increments

2. Acceptance (Right):
   - Alert confirmation
   - If confirmed: Shows acceptance screen
   - If cancelled: Card returns to center

### End States
1. All Rejected:
   - "No more groups to see" message
   - Reset button to start over

2. Group Accepted:
   - "Group accepted!" message
   - Shows accepted group name
   - Reset button to start over

## Usage Notes
1. Only two cards rendered at a time for performance
2. Videos auto-play only on active card
3. Scroll and swipe gestures are mutually exclusive
4. Shadow effect creates clear visual hierarchy
5. Reset functionality for demo purposes
