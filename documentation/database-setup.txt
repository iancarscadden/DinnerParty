We will now be setting up the supabase database for our project. 

The first step will be implementing a user onboarding process, where a user can log in or sign up with supabase auth.
When designing the onboarding process for our app, we want to use general practice to make it so that
if there is no authenticated user, the app will direct the user to the onboarding process when it is opened
where the user can then log in or sign up depending on what they need to do.
Obviously, if there is an authenticated user, the app will direct the user to the main app screen.

will be seting up the onboarding screens in screens/onboarding

where we can name the onboarding by what step it is on. 

we also want to put all our files we need / scripts / logic for the supabase auth / all future script queries in
the /services folder.

lets now set up supabase in our project, evyerthing we need for it, as we will be using it for auth, databaseing
as well as storage.

for now we will also be writing to the users table in databse scema, which for now will just have a user id,
a name, and a url to a profile picture. the descrition to this is contained in the database-tables.txt file.

We will be writing to the users table in the database-functions.txt file so we always have a current understanding 
of how we are wrting and querying the database for our app needs. And we will be updating
the database-tables.txt file as we add/need more tables/fields for tables to the database as we expand
to encompass more of the app needs.
