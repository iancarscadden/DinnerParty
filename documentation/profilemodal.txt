This is a textual outline of what the group profile modal should look like. When shown to a user

This will be used when a user presses on a pin on the map, which will bring up the group
profile of the group that the pin represents.

Outline of how to modal will come up:
- The modal should look like it comes out of the screen from the pin thats being pressed.
- The modal will have a X button on the top right corner.
- The modal will also have a title in bold from the top left corner that will be the hosts name followed by "Dinner Party"
 - for example it will say "Ian's Dinner Party"
 - Then the top line of the modal will be 3 profile pictures of the hosts of the group.
 - Right under each profile picture will be the name of the member associated with the profile picture (for exmaple "Ian", "Eli", "Adam")
 - then below this middle centered will be "7:00om Friday, 2/25/2025"
 - then below this will say the menu - there will be entre taht says steak and avacado
 - We will then incorportate 3 video of the hosts group. so below the text components there will be 3 videos vertically stacked. 
 These videos will take up space so we will need to make the profile a scrollable modal. we also want all these videos to be the same size. so we 
 will need to do some padding and margin calculations to make sure they are all the same size.

- We also want the videos to all be playing at the same time, so as the user scrolls down the videos will play.
- We also at the bottom of the modal (this part will not be included in the scroll view as it will alaways be there) will the a button on the left
thats says "Hide Party" which is grey and then a button that says Request to Attend which is Green. 

The file for this modal will be placed in the /screens/group-profile-modal.tsx file. for this iteration we will be using dummy hard coded data, as well 
as a hardcoded videos that will be named "video1.mp4", "video2.mp4", "video3.mp4" which will be in the assets/videos folder.
