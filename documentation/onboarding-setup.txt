okay great it seems everything is working. Lets now create some basic onboarding screens in 
screens/onboarding, where there will be multiple steps, the first screen will just say welcome 
to dinner party on it, with a continue button at the bottom, the next screen will say enter your email 
and a password with a continue at the bottom, this will then send a verification code to the email, which we will
through supabase where we have already set up custom smtp: here is the email:

it is the template for "confirm signup": 

here the code:

<h2>Confirm Your Signup</h2>

<p>Thank you for signing up! Please use the verification code below to confirm your email address:</p>

<h3>{{ .Token }}</h3>

<p>Alternatively, you can confirm your email by clicking the link below:</p>

<p><a href="{{ .ConfirmationURL }}">Confirm your email</a></p>

<p>If you did not sign up for this account, please disregard this email.</p>

As you can see, it will be so the user can enter a code that is sent to their email with the .Token, which 
when the user enters this in the code entry screen for onbaoroding, when its verified they will then, be sent 
to the next screen, where the user will enter their first name, and then hit contune, then the user 
will enter a profile picture, where they can then hit contine, and then this whill all be written to their
users table in supabse, where they will then be in an authenticated state, and can then be routed to the 
main tabs of the app.
