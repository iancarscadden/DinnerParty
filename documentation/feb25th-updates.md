# February 25th Updates - Dinner Party Hosting Implementation

## Overview
Today we implemented the core functionality for hosting dinner parties, including:
- Database functions for dinner party management
- Host screen UI with conditional rendering
- Two-step party creation form with animations
- Location selection with Google Places integration
- Improved UI/UX with visual feedback and clear user guidance

## Database Implementation
### New Types and Functions
Added in `services/groups.ts`:

```typescript
interface DinnerParty {
  id: string;
  group_id: string;
  main_dish: string;
  side: string;
  address: string;
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  is_active: boolean;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}

// Function to create a dinner party
async function createDinnerParty(
  groupId: string,
  partyDetails: {
    main_dish: string;
    side: string;
    address: string;
    latitude: number;
    longitude: number;
  }
): Promise<DinnerParty | null>

// Function to get active dinner party for a group
async function getGroupDinnerParty(groupId: string): Promise<DinnerParty | null>
```

## Host Screen Implementation
The host screen (`screens/host-screen.tsx`) now features:
- Enhanced UI with icons, cards, and visual feedback
- Conditional rendering based on group status
- Host party button (only enabled for group leaders)
- Detailed status messages for different states:
  - No group (with icon)
  - Group not ready (with icon)
  - Not leader (with disabled button)
  - Active party (with party details)
- Integration with the party creation form
- Active party details display with badge and formatted information

## Party Creation Form
New component `CreatePartyForm` implements a two-step process with smooth animations:

### Step 1: Menu Details
- Clean, focused UI for entering dishes
- Input fields for main dish and side dish
- Validation to ensure both fields are filled
- Progress indicator showing current step
- Navigation buttons:
  - Cancel: Returns to host screen
  - Next: Animates to location selection (disabled if fields empty)

### Step 2: Location Selection
- Google Places Autocomplete integration with improved UI
- Location icon and visual enhancements
- Location search with suggestions in a properly styled dropdown
- Selected location display with confirmation
- Tips for users when no location is selected
- Progress indicator showing current step
- Navigation buttons:
  - Back: Animates back to menu details
  - Create Party: Submits form (disabled until location selected)

### Technical Improvements
- Fixed VirtualizedList nesting issue by restructuring component
- Implemented proper keyboard handling with KeyboardAvoidingView
- Added SafeAreaView for proper iOS spacing
- Improved z-indexing for location suggestions
- Added crypto polyfill for UUID generation
- Smooth animations between steps using Animated API
- Proper error handling and loading states

## Location Selection Features
- Biased to SDSU area (32.7757,-117.0719) with 5km radius

- Automatic extraction of:
